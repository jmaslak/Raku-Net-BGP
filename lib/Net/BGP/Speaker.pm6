=head1 NAME

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::BGP::Speaker;
    
    $speaker = Net::BGP::Speaker.new(
        allow-unknown-peers => False,
        asn-filter => 65000,
        cidr-filter => "10.0.0.0/16,192.168.0.0/16",
        colored => True,
    )

=head1 TYPES

=head2 our subset Asn of Int:D where ^2³²

Defines a subset covering legal ASN numbers.

=head2 our subset Port of Int:D where ^2¹⁶

Defines a subset covering legal TCP/IP port numbers.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head1 allow-unwanted-peers

Allow unknown peers to be able to connect without having been pre-configured.

=head2 colored

Note that this attribute can't be set directly except at construction time,
however it can be changed via a helper method:

  say "Colored!" if $speaker.colored;
  $speaker.colored(True);  # Make colored

If this is set to true, log messages will be displayed using ANSI-compatible
colored text.

=head2 communities

A list of communities to use when advertising routes.  Communities are
specified in string form (I.E. "65000:1000").

=head2 display

This is a L<Net::BGP::Speaker::Display> object.  It's intended to be
created during object construction, but it can be overriden by a subclass
of this object during construction.

=head2 listen-host

The host to listen on for BGP connections on (defaults to C<0.0.0.0>).  This
is a string.

=head2 listen-port

The port number to listen for BGP connections on (defaults to C<179>).

=head2 my-asn

Our Autonymous System Number.

=head2 my-domain

Domain name of local system, to be sent in FQDN capability during OPEN.
Can be undefined, which will result in L<Net::BGP> attempting to guess
the domain name.

=head2 my-hostname

Hostname of local system, to be sent in FQDN capability during OPEN.
Can be undefined, which will result in L<Net::BGP> attempting to guess
the host name.

=head2 my-asn

Our Autonymous System Number.

=head2 wanted-asn

A list of C<Asn> objects that we are interested in observing.
This can also be set by passing the constructor a comma-seperated string
of ASNs the :asn-filter pseudo-attribute.

=head2 wanted-cidr

A list of L<Net::BGP::CIDR> objects that we are interested in observing.
This can also be set by passing the constructor a comma-seperated string
of CIDRs as the :cidr-filter pseudo-attribute.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 peer-add

  $bgp.peer-add(
      :peer-asn(65001),
      :peer-ip("192.0.2.1"),
      :peer-port(179),
      :passive(False),
      :ipv4(True),
      :ipv6(False),
      :md5($key),
  );

Add a new peer to the BGP server.

Provide the peer information (C<peer-asn>, C<peer-ip>, and C<peer-port>),
along with whether this should be a C<passive> session, whether the
C<ipv4> and C<ipv6> address families should be negotiated, and, if necessary,
an C<md5> key.
